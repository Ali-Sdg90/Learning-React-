<h1>Learning React</h1>
<p>
    This repository serves as a record of my learning process in React. I am
    currently enrolled in a React.js course available at
    <a href="https://botostart.ir/courses/react-js" target="_new">Botostart</a>.
    As I progress through the course and expand my knowledge, I will regularly
    update this repository with my code samples, exercises, and projects.
</p>

<p>Happy coding! ðŸš€</p>
